         french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium and France. <br>
         They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, <br>
         and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection <br>
         ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</p>
