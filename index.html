    <p> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger" target="_blank">burger</a> is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food" target="_blank">food</a> consisting of 
        fillings which are usually a patty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_meat" target="_blank">ground meat</a>,<br>
        typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef" target="_blank"> beef </a> which is placed inside a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bun" target="blank">sliced bun</a> or 
        
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bread_roll" target="_blank"> roll</a>.</p>

        <p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger" target="_blank">burger</a> can also be applied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty" target="_blank">meat patty</a> on its own, especially in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">United Kingdom</a>, <br>
            where the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty" target="_blank">patty</a> is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_meat" target="_blank">ground beef</a>.<br>
            Since the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburger" target="_blank">hamburger</a> usually implies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef" target="_blank">beef</a>, for clarity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger" target="_blank">burger</a> may be prefixed with the type of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meat" target="_blank">meat</a> <br>
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meat" target="_blank">meat</a>a substitute used, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burger" target="_blank">beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, <br>
            portobello burger, or veggie burger</a>.</p>

            <p><br> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" target="_blank">Australia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" target="_blank">New Zealand</a>, a piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_breast" target="_blank">chicken breast</a>
            on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bun" target="_blank">bun</a> is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_breast" target="_blank"></a>chicken burger,<br>
            which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank">United States</a>; <br>
            Americans would generally call it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Sandwich" target="_blank"></a>chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich <br>
            requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sliced_bread" target="_blank">sliced bread</a> (not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bun" target="_blank">bun</a>), so it would not be considered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandwich" target="_blank">sandwich</a>.</p>

            <p> A  veggie burger is a hamburger patty that does not contain meat. It may be made from ingredients like <br>
                 beans, especially soybeans and tofu, nuts, grains, seeds or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein.  <br>
                The patties that are the essence of a veggie burger have existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia, <br>
                including in the form of disc-shaped grilled or fried meatballs or as koftas, a commonplace item in Indian cuisine. <br>
                These may contain meats or be made of entirely vegetarian ingredients such as legumes or other plant-derived proteins.</p>

            <p> A burger is only as good as whatâ€™s placed between the buns and the patty at least according to Americans who say they like burgers. <br>
                Just 2 percent of that group say they do not put toppings on their burgers, leaving a vast majority to debate their favorites. <br>
                Nearly three in four (74%) say they typically use cheese as a burger topping, followed by ketchup (65%), <br>
                lettuce (64%), tomatoes (58%), onions (57%), pickles (54%), and mustard (52%).<br> <br>
                 At least one in five say they also like bacon (45%), mayo/aioli (43%), mushrooms (23%),<br>
                and fries (20%) on their burgers. </p>

            <p> Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories,<br>
                in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties <br>
                with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side.</p>

            <p>The common story is that WWI soldiers returning from Europe had been introduced to french fries in Belgium, <br>
               and so there was a demand for it. Meanwhile, White Castle was looking for a side dish for their burgers, <br>
               and fries happened to be a good fit. They were cheap to make.</p>
